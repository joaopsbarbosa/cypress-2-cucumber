# cypress-2-cucumber ðŸ¥’
As a Test Automation Engineer working with Cypress.io I've been strugling to find some solutions for my problems. 
I tried to find a way to create a report for my Cypress tests and the best one that I found was using Cucumber, but I had a problem.
All of my code/tests was done and now, using Cucumber, I need to change all the template. It means, no describe() and no it(), etc etc. Like, you know.
So I spend some time creating a batch file that you can run it inside of project folder and this batch file will convert all of your Cypress code to Cucumber.

## Usage
This is basically a `batch` file, so you just need to be using Windows and run this file inside you project.

Location for your cypress-2-cucumber.bat file:
```
$ your_cypress_project
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugins
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ support
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ cypress-2-cucumber.bat
```

Then, double click on it and let it make the magic ðŸª„.
